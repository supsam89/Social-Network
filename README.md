# Social-Network
Coding a private custom social network. This project uses Flask and sqlite Python modules with some HTML and SQL code too.

## Prerequisites
In order for the files to work I have created a virtual environment with Flask module installed. We will also be using the module sqlite3 which can be set as path.

## Create a clean database
To create a clean database that is linked with the schema.sql file we execute
```
sqlite3 database.db < schema.sql
```
